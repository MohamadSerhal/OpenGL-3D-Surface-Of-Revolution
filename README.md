# OpenGL-3D-Surface-Of-Revolution
C++ OpenGL project that allows a user to create a 3D mesh using the surface revolution method.      
Note: The project might not work immediatly since it requires libraries to be linked correctly. Use visual studio 2019 and open the solution.    

##How to use:
- draw points by pressing on the screen
- press f to draw curve (2D Bspline)
- press m to change from "edit" to display mode (from 2D to 3D)
- Mouse press and move to rotate object
- In display mode press n to go back to edit mode and draw another shape.


NOTICE: I have header files and libraries I used in special locations on my machine and saved them in the project settings. If this causes an issue, go to c++ and directories and remove the path of my directories. (If it complains that its not able to find them)
